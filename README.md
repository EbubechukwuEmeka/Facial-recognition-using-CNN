Facial Recognition using CNN

This GitHub repository contains an implementation of facial recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Facial recognition is a popular computer vision task that involves identifying and verifying a person's face in an image or video. The repository provides a comprehensive solution for building a facial recognition system using deep learning techniques.

Key Features:

CNN Model: The repository includes a robust CNN model specifically designed for facial recognition tasks. The model is trained on large-scale face datasets to achieve high accuracy and generalization.
Preprocessing Utilities: It provides a set of preprocessing utilities for face detection, alignment, and normalization. These utilities help prepare the input images for optimal facial feature extraction.
Training Pipeline: The repository offers a training pipeline that facilitates the training of the CNN model on custom datasets. It includes data augmentation techniques and supports transfer learning for faster convergence and improved performance.
Face Embeddings: The implementation extracts facial features and generates face embeddings using the trained CNN model. These embeddings can be used for face identification, verification, or clustering purposes.
Face Recognition Applications: The repository showcases practical applications of facial recognition, including face identification and face verification. It provides code examples and tutorials to help users understand and utilize the implemented functionalities.
Evaluation Metrics: The repository includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the facial recognition system.
